# gitreview-gpt

`gitreview-gpt` reviews your git changes with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model from command line and provides detailed review comments with the corresponding line numbers.
Your `git diff` is extensively parsed to a well comprehensible format for the `gpt-3.5-turbo` completion api to get precise feedback based on your code changes.
